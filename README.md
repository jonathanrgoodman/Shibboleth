The code for the three models, Shibboleth 1, 2, and 3, for R, are included here; they can be uploaded to R and run as functions. The default parameters are N = 50; traits = 10; generations = 200; cost = 10; B = 0.2. The colorRamps package (Keitt, 2007; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorRamps/colorRamps.pdf) is required to run the functions. 

The .rds files included are the averaged results from the models' runs; they can be uploaded to R. The file drift5000.rds holds the results from the stochastic drift (comparator) model. We created models from the models' outputs using the script that can be found <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonathanrgoodman/Shibboleth/blob/main/Shibbboleth-Analysis.nb.html">here</a>.
